title: Notes on the Wishart and inverse Wishart distributions

In the *Bayesian data analysis* book (3rd ed), the authors make the
following claim: *Setting ${\bf\Sigma} \sim
\mbox{Inv-Wishart}_{d+1}({\bf I})$ has the appealing feature that each
of the correlations in Σ has, marginally, a uniform prior
distribution.*
[Note: ${\bf\Sigma}$ and ${\bf I}$ are $d \times d$ matrices.] Here I
check this claim in some small simulations.

```{r knitr-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",collapse = TRUE,results = "hold",
                      fig.align = "center",dpi = 120)
```

Load the packages needed for this analysis:

```{r load-pkgs}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```
