We investigate the performance of SuSiE model for summary statistics with various types of covariance (LD) matrices. We consider 5 types of covariance matrices:
1. In-sample LD matrix: Gold standard
2. Out-sample LD matrix: LD matrix $\widehat{R}$ calculated from a out-of-sample data
3. Regularized: $\widehat{R}_{\lambda} = (1-\lambda) * \widehat{R} + \lambda * I$ with $\lambda = 0.1$
3. Truncated SVD: $\tilde{R}$ as presented in the paper
3. TSVD + Reg.: $\tilde{R}_{\lambda} = (1-\lambda) * \tilde{R} + \lambda * I$ with $\lambda = 0.1$
